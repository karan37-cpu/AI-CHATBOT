# 🤖 AI Chatbot with NLP

This project demonstrates how to build an **AI-powered chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python. The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user queries by leveraging popular NLP libraries such as **NLTK** and **spaCy**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **AI Chatbot with NLP** project showcases the development of an intelligent conversational agent that can process and respond to user inputs in natural language. It is built using Python and incorporates fundamental and advanced NLP concepts, including tokenization, lemmatization, named entity recognition, and intent matching.

The chatbot functions by interpreting the user's input, analyzing its meaning, and generating a relevant response. This is made possible by training the chatbot on predefined patterns and responses or integrating external knowledge bases for more complex interactions.

The project is ideal for beginners looking to get hands-on experience with NLP and chatbot design. It’s also a strong starting point for more advanced projects like voice assistants, customer support bots, or AI tutors.
